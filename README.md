# Text Editor
This basic text editor was written in an hour, and can only read and write files of any kind.
Run `main_mod.py` to run the program.
## Files
* `.ui files` - .xml files containing the UI.
* `*_auto.py files` - Contains .ui files converted to .ui files
* `main_mod.py` - Main UI that opens other files
* `open_mod.py` - Program that opens the files
* `save_mod.py` - Program that saves the files.
## Prerequisites
* PyQt4 - Download the .whl and install here: https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyqt4
* Python3 - Most versions of python 3.X should work. Download it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
## How it was made
It was easily constructed using the open() command in python and Object Oriented Programming.
## Future Ideas
* Adding keyword highlighting, like highlighting `for` in .py files
* Adding support for multiple files at once.
