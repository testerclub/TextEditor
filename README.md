# Text Editor
This basic text editor was written in an hour, and can only read and write files of any kind.
## Prerequisites
* PyQt4 - Download the .whl and install here: https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyqt4
* Python3 - Most versions of python 3.X should work. Download it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
## How it was made
It was easily constructed using the open() command in python and Object Oriented Programming.
## Future Ideas
* Adding keyword highlighting, like highlighting `for` in .py files
* Adding support for multiple files at once.
